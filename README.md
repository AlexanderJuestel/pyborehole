# PyBore - Processing and visualizing borehole data

`pybore` is a Python library for processing and visualizing borehole data. It is similar to the `welly`package building 
upon several libraries such as `lasio` and `wellpathpy` to process borehole data. 

## Functionality
The functionality of `pybore` includes:

* Reading and visualizing well logs using `lasio`
* Reading and visualizing well deviation paths and desurveying the well using `wellpathpy`
* Parsing XML files written in [BoreholeML](https://www.bgr.bund.de/Infogeo/DE/Home/BoreholeML/boreholeml_node.html)
