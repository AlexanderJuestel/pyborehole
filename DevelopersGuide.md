Sphinx Gallery Building
-----------------------

Example and tutorial notebooks are stored in the root folder under examples. In order to use Sphinx Gallery, these notebooks have to be converted to ``.py`` files. This can be done using the Anaconda prompt. Navigate to the ``pyborehole`` folder containing the ``.py`` file and execute
